# SmartQueue: AI-Based Patient Triage System

SmartQueue is an AI-powered triage system developed as part of a Machine Learning Internship at **Feynn Labs**. It assists hospitals and clinics in prioritizing OPD patients based on symptom severity. Built using Python, Streamlit, and a trained Random Forest Classifier, it helps healthcare providers classify patients into Low, Medium, or High risk â€” in real time.

## Features

- âœ… Streamlit web interface for real-time triage
- âœ… Random Forest ML model for risk prediction
- âœ… Dummy patient generator for testing
- âœ… Color-coded alerts for critical cases
- âœ… Risk category bar chart (optional)
- âœ… Export patient queue data to CSV

## Why SmartQueue?

- Reduces patient waiting time
- Ensures high-risk cases are prioritized
- Ideal for Tier-2/3 hospitals with minimal HMS infrastructure
- Lightweight & deployable on local or cloud servers
- Built with simplicity and scalability in mind

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend/UI**: Streamlit
- **ML Model**: Random Forest Classifier (scikit-learn)
- **Backend**: Python 3.12
- **Data Handling**: pandas, NumPy
- **Model Serialization**: joblib

## Sample Patient Prediction
You can generate a dummy patient in the app or manually input symptoms.
The model predicts a risk score and maps it to a label:

ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk

ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk

ðŸ”´ High Risk

## Financial Forecast (from report)
Revenue = (Monthly Fee Ã— Hospitals) - Operating Costs

Sample:
Revenue = (100 Ã— â‚¹1999) - â‚¹8000 = â‚¹1,91,900/month
