# SmartQueue: AI-Based Patient Triage System

SmartQueue is an AI-powered triage system developed as part of a Machine Learning Internship at **Feynn Labs**. It assists hospitals and clinics in prioritizing OPD patients based on symptom severity. Built using Python, Streamlit, and a trained Random Forest Classifier, it helps healthcare providers classify patients into Low, Medium, or High risk — in real time.
